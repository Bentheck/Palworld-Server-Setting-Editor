Simple dedicated server settings file editor for Palworld

- click load
- go to your server settings location (normaly: \steamapps\common\PalServer\Pal\Saved\Config\WindowsServer\)
- select PalWorldSettings.ini
- enjoy the readable interface
- save once you are done editing
- enjoy the game with whomever you want :)

If you ever make a mistake click on clear and reload your file.

It is my first program published therefore I am even less experienced than a junior and it is the only way i found to go around an error whil trying to reload while something is already loaded.
